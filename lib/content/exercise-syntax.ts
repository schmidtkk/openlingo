## Unit Frontmatter

Every unit starts with YAML frontmatter containing ALL metadata. The frontmatter is the single source of truth:

\`\`\`
---
unitTitle: "Unit Title"
description: "Short English description of what this unit teaches"
icon: "📘"
color: "#4CAF50"
targetLanguage: "de"
sourceLanguage: "en"
level: "B1"
---
\`\`\`

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| unitTitle | yes | Unit title (in the target language) |
| description | yes | Short English description |
| icon | yes | Single emoji |
| color | yes | Hex color code |
| targetLanguage | yes | ISO 639-1 language code being learned (e.g. "de", "fr", "es") |
| sourceLanguage | yes | ISO 639-1 native language code (e.g. "en") |
| level | yes | CEFR level: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2 |

## Lesson Sections

After the unit frontmatter, each lesson is defined by a \`---\` delimited metadata block:

\`\`\`
---
lessonTitle: "Greetings"
description: "Learn basic greeting phrases"
icon: "👋"
color: "#FF9600"
---

\`\`\`

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| lessonTitle | yes | Lesson title |
| description | no | Short description of the lesson |
| icon | no | Single emoji |
| color | no | Hex color code |

## Exercise Blocks

Exercises are written in markdown files. Each exercise block starts with a type tag
\`[type-name]\` and fields are written as \`key: value\`. The parser splits on type tags
automatically — no \`---\` separators needed (though they're accepted and ignored).

## Comments

Lines starting with \`//\` (with optional leading whitespace) are stripped before parsing:

\`\`\`
// This is a comment — it will be ignored
[multiple-choice]
text: "What color is the sky?"
// Maybe add more choices later
choices:
  - "Blue" (correct)
  - "Green"
\`\`\`

## SRS Word Tracking

Every exercise **must** include an \`srsWords\` field listing the target-language word(s) to track in the spaced repetition system.
Words practiced correctly reinforce the card; incorrect answers flag them for review.

For most exercises this will be a single word. Use quotes for the value.

\`\`\`
srsWords: "gato"
\`\`\`

For multiple words, quote each one on the same line:

\`\`\`
srsWords: "gato" "perro"
\`\`\`

For \`matching-pairs\`, srsWords are auto-inferred from the left side of the pairs if omitted.
